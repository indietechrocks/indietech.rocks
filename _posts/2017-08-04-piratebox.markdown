PirateBox almost didn't make our listing, because it is a Do-It-Yourself,
buy-your-own-parts, assembly-most-definitely-required kind of thing. But it's
documented and productized enough that reasonably skilled people can set it up.

What is it? Basically, you take a little computer like the Raspberry Pi with
WiFi, put on the PirateBox software, and it acts as a WiFi hotspot. When you
connect with your laptop or phone, you can share files with others on the 
same WiFi network, chat with them, message board, and media stream -- all
without privacy concerns because all your data and behavior does not ever
get sent to the cloud.
