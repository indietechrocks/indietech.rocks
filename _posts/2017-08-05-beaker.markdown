As they say: "Beaker is a peer-to-peer browser with tools to create and host
websites. Don't just browse the Web, build it."

You can use Beaker like any other web browser, such as Firefox. But Beaker can do two
more tricks than other browsers:

* display web pages from the Dat peer-to-peer network, and
* give you the tools to create web pages on that Dat peer-to-peer network.

Setup a website without needing to set up a web server? A great idea (limited
to those people who have a browser that can browse the Dat network, but that might
be good enough for your needs, depending what they are)
