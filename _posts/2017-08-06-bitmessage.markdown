From their <a href="https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page">website</a>:

<blockquote>
Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages to
another person or to many subscribers. It is decentralized and trustless,
meaning that you need-not inherently trust any entities like root
certificate authorities. It uses strong authentication which means that the
sender of a message cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide "non-content" data,
like the sender and receiver of messages, from passive eavesdroppers
like those running warrantless wiretapping programs.
