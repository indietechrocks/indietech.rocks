Loomio is decision-making software to assist groups with collaborative decision-making processes.
It is a free software web application. Users initiate discussions and put up proposals. As
discussions progress the group receives feedback on a proposal through an up-datable pie chart.

It is built by a core of group of developers based in Wellington, New Zealand.
There are contributors to the project from around the world.
