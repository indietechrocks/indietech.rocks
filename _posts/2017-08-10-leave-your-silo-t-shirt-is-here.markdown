We couldn't resist and made a T-shirt.

Why not express your support for independent technology in public? Beats running around with
some other corporate logo, from The North Face to Google.

<div style="margin: 20px; text-align: center">
 <a href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/indietech/"><img src="/images/t-shirt.png"></a>
</div>

It available in a variety of sizes and styles
<a href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/indietech/">from Spreadshirt</a>.
Just watch out not to order a color that's really bright, because
the writing is light, not dark.
