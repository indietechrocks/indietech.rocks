They say about themselves:

<blockquote>Inkscape is an open-source vector graphics editor similar to
Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw, Freehand, or Xara X. What sets Inkscape
apart is its use of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), an open XML-based
W3C standard, as the native format.</blockquote>

If they would want to lock you in, they'd use a proprietary format, not
an open standard, as their core data representation. Compare with what
other vector graphics packages do.
