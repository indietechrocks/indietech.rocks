From their <a href="https://project.hubzilla.org/page/hubzilla/hubzilla-project">site</a>:
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Decentralized network of hubs: the grid</dt>
<dd>Hubs are the servers that communicate with one another to propagate information across the
network, or "grid". There is no central hub or single point of failure. Hubs can be connected
to as many or as few other hubs as desired.</dd>
<dt>Channels and Connections</dt>
<dd>A channel is the fundamental (id)entity on the grid. A channel can represent many different
things: a person, a blog, or a forum to name a few. Channels can make connections with other
channels to share information with highly detailed permissions. Channels are addressed using a
familiar channel@hub.domain format.</dd>
<dt>Nomadic Identity and Cloning</dt>
<dd>Nomadic identity means true ownership of online identity. With Hubzilla, you don't have an
account on a server, you own an identity that you can take with you across the grid. You can
clone a channel across multiple hubs for resilience against network failures or censorship,
or you can completely move a channel from one hub to another, taking your data and connections
with you.</dd>
