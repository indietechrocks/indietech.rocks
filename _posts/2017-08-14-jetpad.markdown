When browsers were young, who would have thought that entire text editors
could run inside them?

JetPad is one of them. But unlike others (like Google docs), it is open-source,
and does not lock you into somebody else's cloud, and you can keep control
over your documents.

Go to the <a href="/products/#JetPad">JetPad</a> listing.
