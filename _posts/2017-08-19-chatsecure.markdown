<blockquote>
<p>ChatSecure is a free and open source messaging app that features
   OTR encryption over XMPP. You can connect to your existing Google
   accounts or create new accounts on public XMPP servers (including
   via Tor), or even connect to your own server for extra security.</p>

<p>Unlike other apps that keep you stuck in their walled garden,
   ChatSecure is fully interoperable with other clients that support
   OTR and XMPP, such as Conversations (Android), CoyIM (Desktop), and
   more.</p>
