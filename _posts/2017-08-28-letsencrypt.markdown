It's hard to argue that encryption on the web is a bad thing. Some people
do, but without encryption, we could not buy anything online or check our
bank account, without being robbed minutes or hours later. On the other
hand, traditional certificate authorities that issue the certificates that
turns an unencrypted (HTTP) website into an encrypted (HTTPS) site have been
(too) complicated to use, and (too) expensive for most.

Enter Letsencrypt, which provides certificates for free, and also offers
a free API. So now every website can be encrypted.

And if you don't like Letsencrypt any more? Just get a certificate from
somewhere else, there's no lock-in.
