Image you value the big web properties -- like Twitter, YouTube or Instagram. But you
also value your ability to remix their content with other content you'd like to 
consume. RSS makes this possible. But then, those big web properties might not
publish RSS feeds. (Perhaps because they don't want you to remix? What a thought!)

Enter RSS-Bridge, an community effort to create RSS feeds from big web properies.
As of the time of this writing, they list about 17 different integrations, including
integrations with Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram and others.
