From their <a href="https://briarproject.org/how-it-works.html">website</a>:

<blockquote>
Briar is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone else who needs a safe,
easy and robust way to communicate. Unlike traditional messaging apps, Briar doesn't rely on a
central server - messages are synchronized directly between the users' devices.
If the internet's down, Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping the information flowing
in a crisis. If the internet's up, Briar can sync via the Tor network, protecting
users and their relationships from surveillance.
