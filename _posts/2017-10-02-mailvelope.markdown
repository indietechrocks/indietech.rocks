Famously, e-mail is about as secure as a postcard: anybody who has
access to a postcard can read what it says, and that's the same
for e-mail.

Encryption for e-mail has existed for a long time, but has generally
been hard to use, and impossible when using a web mail provider such
as Gmail or Yahoo Mail.

Enter Mailvelope, a browser plugin that lets you encrypt and
decrypt mail messages right from the browser, regardless of whether
your e-mail provider is in favor or against that idea.
