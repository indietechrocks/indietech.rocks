 <h1>Collecting Products That Don't Screw Us</h1>

 <p>Too many products do things behind their users' backs. Sometimes it feels
    there's nothing anybody can do about that. But: often there are less-known
    alternatives that don't screw their users.</p>
 <p>On this site, we collect them, so they are easier to find.

  <li>Here are the <a href="/products/">products</a> we know of so far.</li>
 </ul>
